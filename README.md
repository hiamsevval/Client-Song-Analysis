## Output

The program outputs a CSV file (`output.csv`) with the **distribution** of distinct play counts:

| DISTINCT_PLAY_COUNT | CLIENT_COUNT |
|---------------------|--------------|
| 2                   | 2            |
| 4                   | 1            |

This means:
- 2 clients listened to 2 distinct songs on 10 Aug 2016
- 1 client listened to 4 distinct songs
